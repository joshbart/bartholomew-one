# Project Olwen

Project Olwen is the collection of code for the main [Bartholomew Family](https://bartholomew.one) website.  It will serve as a landing page with a description and hold links to other resources, such as a geneology app and mail distros.

_About the project name_: The name [Olwen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olwen) means "white footprint".  She was a mythological figure in whose footprints white trefoils would grow.  Due to her gentleness and association with flowers, she was chosen to represent the main website of the Bartholomew family.
